    "| **Two-temperature, Magnetically Arrested Disc simulations of the jet from the supermassive black hole in M87** — Chael, Narayan & Johnson (2018/19) ([arXiv][1])               | This is one of the first full 2-temperature GRRMHD simulations of a MAD disk + jet. The authors explicitly compare two different electron-heating prescriptions (turbulent cascade vs reconnection) and show that **in strongly magnetized (“jet/funnel”) regions**, electron temperatures become very high, which heavily influences the resulting emission spectrum. This demonstrates that applying a naive uniform heating law (or “simple” RBETA) across a MAD can lead to unphysical or at least strongly model-dependent results. ([arXiv][1]) |\n",
    "| **Comparison of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio prescription: GRMHD simulations with electron thermodynamics** — Mizuno, Fromm, Porth, Younsi et al. (2021) ([arXiv][2]) | This paper studies the commonly used R–β prescription (i.e. RBETA-like) *in the context of MAD flows*. They compare R–β to more physically motivated electron-heating prescriptions, and find that while R–β can sometimes reproduce similar 230 GHz images, **the consistency is fragile** when jets/funnel regions are present. The authors point out that in MAD flows, simple R–β assumptions may not capture the complex physics of electron heating, especially in magnetically dominated zones.

The paper shows how **sensitive** model observables (SEDs, polarization, emission structure) are to the heating prescription — especially in the jet/funnel, and emphasizes the uncertainty in choosing a “correct” electron heating model for MAD states.
